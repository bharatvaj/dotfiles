# X11

```
# Launch firefox as user without xorg
# .config/X11/xinitrc file should be cleared for this to work, otherwise it would launch i3
xinit firefox $* -- :0 vt$XDG_VTNR


# Configure xauth manually
# $HOST was not defined in arch, I added it manually when using it
xauth add ${HOST}:0 . $(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)
